        <p><b>SoCal Edison Solar Initiative Project</b><br>
			<br>
			Within a group of 5 people in the Data Analytics Team, we were able to research on the sustainability goals for SoCal Edison. I led a project to identify optimal locations for solar electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Southern California. Leveraging the powerful data visualization and analysis tools provided by Tableau, our team was able to identify areas where there was high demand for EV charging stations, as well as significant potential for solar energy generation.<br>
			<br>
			Using a variety of data sources including solar irradiance maps, EV sales data, electricity demand and usage information, and existing EV charging station locations, we were able to develop a comprehensive picture of the energy landscape in Southern California. By analyzing this data in Tableau, we were able to identify locations where installing solar EV charging stations would not only provide a reliable source of energy for EV owners, but also enable the building to generate excess energy that could be used to power the building. <br>
			<br>
			Our work was inspired by a similar study conducted in Austin, Texas, and we were proud to present our findings to 8 representatives of SoCal Edison.

		<p><b>ITC Data Analytics Competition (1st Place)</b><br>
			<br>Competed in MISSA's Information Technology Competition in the Data Analytics Category, being the most competitive category with 8 competing teams.			<br>
			<br>We were given a	dataset on a fictional company named IBEC with data from all the failed transformers. We were given the failure causes, information on the transformers including region, kWh, etc. and our goal was to find trends and insights within the data to help IBEC decrease the amount of transformer failures and increase their lifespan withhin their company as well as develop a plan to achieve these goals.		<br>
			<br>We utilized SQL and Tableau to gain insights within the data and our biggest finding was seeing trends within the data after eliminating non-relevant factors from the number of failure causes per factor. For example, car hitting pole is not affected by the kWh, so we would eliminate those failures from the total failures from that specific kWh.
